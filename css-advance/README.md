## CSS Advance
Cascading Style Sheets (**CSS**) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). **CSS** describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

### Module 1: Flexbox

### Module 3: SASS
In this module, Sass is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files.

### Module 4: Transition & Animation
In this module, CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.

### Module 5: Bootstrap 5
In this module, Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

### Module 6: CSS GRID
The CSS grid layout module excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements

### Module 7: CSS basic & advance selector
A CSS selector is the part of a CSS ruleset that allows you to select the element you want to style by type, attributes, or location within the HTML document.

### Module 8: Specificity And Inheritance
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element

In inheritance when no value for an inherited property has been specified on an element, the element gets the computed value of that property on its parent element.

### Module 9: BEM CSS architecture
BEM is a front-end naming method for organizing and naming CSS classes. The Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for class names in HTML and CSS. It helps to write clean CSS by following some simple rules
