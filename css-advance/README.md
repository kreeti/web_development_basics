## CSS Advance
Cascading Style Sheets (**CSS**) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). **CSS** describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
